# Installing PolyMc
PolyMc works with the fabric modloader. You can install it as a server <a href="https://fabricmc.net/wiki/tutorial:installing_minecraft_fabric_server">here</a>.
Install the latest PolyMc version [from here](https://theepicblock.nl/builds) and place it in the mods folder. Together with any mod you'd like to use with PolyMc. 

## Generating the resource pack
PolyMc requires a resource pack to be installed on the client to function*. You can generate the resource pack by running the `/polymc generate resources` command.
It will appear in the root of your server in a folder named `resource`. How you distribute the resource pack is up to you.

**Warning**: please check if you have the legal right to redistribute the assets of the mods you're using.

*\* It's technically possible to use PolyMc without a resource pack. But it would require some extreme hacks and usage of the api. You're on your own.*
