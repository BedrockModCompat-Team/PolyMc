        <h2>Installing PolyMc</h2>
        <div>
          PolyMc works with the fabric modloader. You can install it as a server <a href="https://fabricmc.net/wiki/tutorial:installing_minecraft_fabric_server">here</a>.
          Install the latest PolyMc version <a href="https://theepicblock.nl/builds">from here</a> and place it in the mods folder. Together with any mod you'd like to use with PolyMc. 
        </div>
        <h2>Generating the resource pack</h2>
        <div>
          PolyMc requires a resource pack to be installed on the client to function*. You can generate the resource pack by running the <code>/polymc gen_resource</code> command.
          It will appear in the root of your server in a folder named <code>resource</code>. How you distribute the resource pack is up to you.
