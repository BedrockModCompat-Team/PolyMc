     * @reason Minecraft assumes the client knows when it breaks a block. The {@code input} argument is used to exclude the player from the packet.
     *          However, PolyMc reimplements block breaking server-side for vanilla-like clients. Therefore we need to change the argument to be null so the packet is also sent to the player initiating the packet.
     *          This makes sure the player receives the block breaking animation even though the server handled the breaking.
